  <p>
    Thanks to everyone who made Fiddler on the Roof Jr. such a smashing success!
    After all of the hard work on rehearsals and set building and production, it really paid off.
    I have gotten so many comments on your wonderful performances.

    I've started putting up a <a href="slide1.html">slide show</a> of the production.
    Please feel free to download the files from the Web site.
    If you want high resolution photos on a photo CD, please contact me.
